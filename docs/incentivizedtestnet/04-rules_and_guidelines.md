### 1. Terms and Conditions
Participation in zkVerify's Incentivized Testnet requires strict adherence to the Terms and Conditions. Please review the full Terms and Conditions document before participating.

### 2. Challenges
The zkVerify Incentivized Testnet is structured around a series of challenges designed to engage a diverse set of participants, including developers, node operators, zero-knowledge projects, and passionate community members.

Phase 1 will commence on September 4, 2024, with an initial set of challenges. As the testnet progresses over time, new challenges will be introduced, encouraging active involvement and showcasing the creativity and technical expertise of the zkVerify community and beyond.

The challenges will vary in duration, with some spanning just a few days and others lasting the entirety of the testnet, to ensure ongoing engagement and appropriate time for challenges completion.

### 3. Testnet Phases 
The testnet will be conducted in multiple phases: 
Phase 1 focuses on two key challenges:

- Building a verification pallet
- Creating a demo application that leverages zkVerify for zero-knowledge proofs verification

Subsequent Phases will be introduced in the next weeks, with new tasks and challenges. More details on Incentivized Testnet duration and detailed point rewards will be unveiled soon.

### 4. Rewards and Incentives
Successful completion of the challenges will be rewarded with points, with the more complex tasks earning higher point values. This fair, points-based system aims to recognize and incentivize meaningful community engagement and participation throughout the testnet.

A dedicated dApp will soon be available where participants can connect their wallets and track their accumulated points and contributions across multiple platforms.

### 5. Submission Process
Each challenge will have its own dedicated submission process, which will be clearly outlined on the corresponding challenge page. Participants will be provided with detailed instructions on how to submit their work for evaluation. This may involve filling out forms, uploading project files, or linking to external repositories, depending on the nature of the challenge. 

### 6. Updates and Communication
Participants should regularly check for updates on the Incentivized Testnet on zkVerifyâ€™s [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/zkverify) and [X](https://x.com/ZKVProtocol) profile, including new challenges, phases, or changes to existing ones. 

Information about future phases, mainnet duration, and point systems will be communicated as it becomes available.

Remember, your participation contributes to the development and robustness of zkVerify. We encourage engagement, innovation, and community collaboration throughout all phases of this Incentivized Testnet. Stay tuned for more information about upcoming Phases and opportunities to contribute.
