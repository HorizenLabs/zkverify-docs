title: Build a Demo App that integrates zkVerify
---

### Overview
The goal is to have Incentivized Testnet participants to build demo apps from scratch that integrate zkVerify as proof verification and settlement layer. We've outlined a variety of use cases to inspire your ideas, but feel free to get creative and build something entirely new. 

This challenge is just the first step in your journey with zero-knowledge technology. We're working on an exciting grant program that will support you through your journey as a dApp founder. More details to be revealed soon. 

### Use cases:

- <b>Secure identity verification platform:</b> develop a basic decentralized identity verification system using zkVerify to ensure privacy and security. This platform would allow users to prove their identity without revealing sensitive information, making it ideal for KYC processes and access control.

- <b>Confidential DeFi lending protocol:</b> build a basic DeFi lending platform that uses zkVerify to protect user privacy. By integrating zero-knowledge proofs, users can borrow and lend funds without exposing their transaction details, enhancing privacy and security in the DeFi ecosystem.

- <b>Privacy-preserving social network:</b> create a basic decentralized social platform where users can interact, share content, and communicate securely using zkVerify. Zero-knowledge proofs would protect user data and interactions, fostering a privacy-centric social experience.

- <b>Confidential payment system:</b>build a basic payment system that uses zkVerify to ensure transaction confidentiality. Users can make payments without exposing transaction details, enhancing privacy for both the payer and payee in various financial applications.

- <b>Private voting system for governance:</b> create a secure and anonymous voting system for decentralized governance using zkVerify. This application ensures the integrity of the voting process while maintaining voter anonymity, making it suitable for DAO decision-making and community governance.

- <b>Private gaming platform:</b> develop a gaming platform, or game that utilizes zkVerify to ensure fair play and privacy. This could include card games like poker, where zero-knowledge proofs prevent cheating and ensure a fair game without revealing player hands. 

- <b>Private auction platform:</b> develop a decentralized auction platform using zkVerify to ensure privacy and fairness. Bidders can participate in auctions without revealing their bids, ensuring a secure and private bidding process.

- <b>Anonymous contribution platform for open-source projects:</b> develop a platform where contributors can make anonymous donations or contributions to open-source projects using zkVerify. This ensures the privacy of contributors while maintaining transparency and accountability for project funding.
