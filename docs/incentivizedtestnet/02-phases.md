## Phase 1 - Build-to-Earn
Welcome to zkVerify's Incentivized Testnet - Phase 1. In this Phase, we have two exciting challenges designed to enhance blockchain privacy and scalability:

- <b>Build a verification pallet:</b> dive into the core of zkVerify by creating a crucial component for our Substrate-based chain. This task involves developing a pallet that efficiently handles the verification of zero-knowledge proofs. zkVerify can accept proofs directly, they don't need to be wrapped in a bn254 compatible zk-proof. We want verifiers for all types of proofs, including STARK's and the new Elliptic Curve. 

- <b>Build a demo dApp:</b> showcase the practical applications of zkVerify by developing a demo dApp from scratch. This challenge encourages you to integrate zkVerify as a proof verification and settlement layer, bringing real-world use cases to life on our platform. One way to do this is take an existing dApp on GitHub, modify it to use zkVerify for its verification, and deploy it. Another way is to upgrade the dApp to use a newer type of zk-proof that can be generated on a mobile device rapidly, and create a mobile dApp.

|  Challenge | Points  | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Build a verification pallet  |  5000 | Active  |
| Build a demo app  | Variable  | Active  |

## Phase 2 - coming soonâ€¦

### For existing zkApps and zkRollups
Are you an existing zkApp or zkRollup looking to offset your ZK proof verification costs? zkVerify can help reduce proof verification time and expense by enabling your app to move to a newer elliptic curve or proof type. Verification time on zkVerify is rapid, and costs are low. We want to hear from you!

Express your interest through this [form](https://forms.gle/uVMgnY4zmNY8i79d6). Briefly describe your current project and how you plan to integrate with zkVerify. We'll contact you for the next phase of our incentivized testnet.

Points and incentives are also allocated for established projects joining our ecosystem.
Don't hesitate to apply, even if you're an established project. We're excited to see how zkVerify can enhance and support your existing zero-knowledge applications!

Remember, this is your chance to be at the forefront of zero-knowledge technology. Whether you're a new developer with a fresh idea or an established project looking to expand, we can't wait to see what you'll build with zkVerify!
