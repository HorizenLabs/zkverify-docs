# What is zkVerify

## zkVerify Defined

zkVerify is an ambitious initiative to develop a modular blockchain system, consisting of two blockchains, the first of which decouples and optimizes for Proof Verification, and in the future the second chain will focus on settlement.

## Goals of zkVerify

zkVerify aims to cut security costs for next-gen blockchains by decoupling settlement from other core functions and segmenting the existing settlement layer even further into two distinct blockchains. In the new system, Proof Verification is segregated from the rest of the settlement layer, similar to how Celestia, Avail, and others isolated Data Availability (DA).
