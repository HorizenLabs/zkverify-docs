## Overview

In this section, we aim to provide end-users with step-by-step guides to achieve their goals with zkVerify!

## How to get started
To get started:
1. Users should first [get a wallet](02-connect-a-wallet.md) and connect it to the network.
2. Then users should [request](03-get_testnet_tokens.md) some $ACME testnet tokens.
3. From there it's possible to proceed in a few different ways.  For those who want to:  
   - Deploy a zkRollup follow the tutorial here for [zkSync](04-run-a-zkrollup/02-zksync_installation.md) or here for [Polygon CDK](04-run-a-zkrollup/04-polygon_cdk_installation.md).
   - Simply submit proofs via [Tenderly](06-submit-proofs/03-polygon_cdk_proof_submission.md) or a Javascript [script](06-submit-proofs/01-javascript-example.md).
   - [Run a node](05-how_to_run_a_node/01-preliminaries.md) and participate in the zkVerify network.
