## Overview

In this section, we aim to provide end-users with step-by-step guides to achieve their goals with zkVerify!

## How to get started

To get started:

1. Users should first [get a wallet](connect-a-wallet) and connect it to the network.
2. Then users should [request](get_testnet_tokens) some $ACME testnet tokens.
3. From there it's possible to proceed in a few different ways.  For those who want to:  
   - Deploy a zkRollup follow the tutorial here for [zkSync](run-a-zkrollup/zksync_installation) or here for [Polygon CDK](run-a-zkrollup/polygon_cdk_installation).
   - Simply submit proofs via [Tenderly](submit-proofs/polygon_cdk_proof_submission) or a Javascript [script](submit-proofs/javascript-example).
   - [Run a node](how_to_run_a_node/getting_started) and participate in the zkVerify network.
