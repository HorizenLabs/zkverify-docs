## Overview

In this section, we aim to provide end-users with step-by-step guides to achieve their goals with zkVerify!

## How to get started

Users should start by [getting a wallet](connect-a-wallet) and connecting it to the network.

From there it's possible to proceed in a few different ways.  For those who want to:  
- Deploy a zkRollup, feel free to explore [this section](run-a-zkrollup).
- Simply submit proofs via a front end application, feel free to explore [this section](submit-proofs/polygon_cdk_proof_submission).
- Run a node and participate in the zkVerify network, feel free to explore [this section](how_to_run_a_node/preliminaries).
