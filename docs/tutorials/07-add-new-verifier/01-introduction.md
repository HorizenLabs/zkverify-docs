## A Home for ZK Needs Verifiers

One of the pillars of zkVerify is represented by the set of verifiers living within it.

It's easy to understand the importance of expanding this set: the more verifiers present in zkVerify, the more proof types it can support. And eventually, the more applications can interact with the ecosystem.

As of now, the zkVerify developers have already included several verifiers (e.g. FFlonk, zkSync, Risc0, Groth16 and more) making the submission and verification of proofs for those proving systems a reality. But the next step would be to have external contributors to integrate new verifiers on their own. This is why this tutorial is provided.

Following this guide you'll be able to integrate your verifier into zkVerify so that, when the runtime is upgraded, everyone will be able to submit and verify proofs for its proving system.
