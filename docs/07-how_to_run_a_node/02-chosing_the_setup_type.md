title: Chosing the Setup Type

## Setup Types

When running a **zkVerify** node, you have two options to choose between:

- **Using Docker (recommended):**
  - Docker provides a convenient and consistent environment for running your node,
  - simplifies deployment and ensures compatibility across different systems,
  - highly recommended for ease of use and maintenance.
- **Using binaries built from source:**
  - if you prefer more control over the installation process, you can build the binaries directly from the source code, available at [NH-core](https://github.com/HorizenLabs/NH-core),
  - requires manual compilation and configuration,
  - suitable for advanced users who want to customize their setup.
