## Prerequisites

Before you begin running your **zkVerify** node, ensure that you have Docker and Docker Compose (v2) installed on your machine.
For checking, open a terminal and type:

```bash
docker --version
```

then type:

```bash
docker compose version
```

if any of the commands is reporting an error you can follow the instructions from the official [Docker guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Hereon, a very basic understanding of Docker concepts and features is assumed; if youâ€™re unfamiliar, proceed anyway and seek additional information online as needed.

Lastly, clone the repository [compose-zkverify-simplified](https://github.com/HorizenLabs/compose-zkverify-simplified) with the command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HorizenLabs/compose-zkverify-simplified.git
```

or directly download the [archive](https://github.com/HorizenLabs/compose-zkverify-simplified/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unzip it.

This repository contains several resources helping you in the preparation of the environment for running your node.

## Basic Items

Inside repository `compose-zkverify-simplified` you can find the main tool you'll use for preparing your environment, the script `scripts/init.sh`. It acts as a step-by-step guide, collecting from you all the requirements and taking care of preparing all the files needed.

Let's now have a brief overview of the basic items required to actually run the node:

- Docker image `horizenlabs/zkverify`:
  - this is the **zkVerify** software packaged up in a Docker image, allowing you to run the node consistently on every platform (Linux, Windows, macOS, ...),
  - the recommended tag is `latest`, otherwise you can pick one of your choice from DockerHub,
  - unless already available on your machine, it will be automatically downloaded from DockerHub by Docker Compose file (see below),
  - you can also build this image using the Docker file [`hl-node.Dockerfile`](https://github.com/HorizenLabs/NH-core/blob/main/docker/dockerfiles/hl-node.Dockerfile).
- Docker Compose file:
  - a common Docker template used to launch the node,
  - automatically generated by `init.sh`.
- `.env` file:
  - configuration file for your node,
  - automatically generated by `init.sh`.
- Secret files:
  - `secret_phrase.dat` file: contains a secret phrase composed of 12 random words selected among a specific dictionary; it is used for generating private and public keys required for authoring and finalizing blocks (needed only for validator nodes),
  - `node_key.dat` file: contains a random 256-bits number; it is the private key required for signing peer-to-peer (p2p) messages and uniquely identifying the node within the network (peer-id),
  - automatically generated by `init.sh`.
