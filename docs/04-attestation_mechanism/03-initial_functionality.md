# Attestation Mechanism Functionality

We start with a centralized approach where the attestation will be posted on the target settlement chain by an authorized relayer controlled by Horizen. The relayer:

- Connects to an Ethereum client.
- Connects to a NH validator node.
- Queries the NH Contract to check the latest published `eth_last_attestation_id`.
- Queries the NH validator node to retrieve the latest `nh_last_attestation_id`
- If `nh_last_attestation_id > eth_last_attestation_id`,  then the last `nh_last_attestation_id - eth_last_attestation_id` are posted by invoking either the `submitAttestation` or `submitAttestationsBatch` smart contract method. This provides some degree of robustness against disconnections of the relayer and reverted transactions.


## Attestation Submission Frequency
The policy leading to the publication of a new attestation is met when one of the following rules is satisfied:
- Last `attestation_id` contains N proofs.
- Last published attestation is older than T seconds and there is at least one proof in the new tree.
- A root user forces the emission of the event.

Note this attestation submission mechanism will cost around 40k-50k gas.  How frequently an attestation should be relayed to a given chain is influenced by different factors:

- Usage of zkVerify Mainchain.
- The fees to be paid by NH to post an attestation on-chain and by users to verify on-chain that their proof is part of the attestation.
- Usersâ€™ choice in terms of cost-finality tradeoff.
- Decoupling of NH Mainchain from the chain(s) which are posting the attestations.
