# What is zkVerify

## zkVerify Defined

zkVerify is a blockchain designed to provide zero knowledge proof verifications for any project or dApp using zero knowledge proofs. A high performance, public, decentralized, reliable, and secure blockchain, zkVerify has dedicated proof verification methods written in Rust, and available to be used in a modular and composable way.

## Goals of zkVerify

zkVerify is focused on the proof verification aspect of zero knowledge proofs. zk-proofs are used to verify computations without disclosing the underlying data, and can be used to summarize transactions, for selective disclosure of identity information, and other specific applications like secret ballot voting and hidden cards in games. 

There are two essential elements of a complete zero knowledge proof. One is the computation which creates the proof, the other is the verification of the proof. Both are needed to verify the computation. Many organizations are working diligently to create better, faster, and more compact proofs, and each of these new zk-proof computations needs proof verifiers available in a reliable and accessible place.

The zkVerify blockchain will accept proofs, verify them, then store both the proof and the verification in the blockchain for future availability
